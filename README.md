##Requirements:

- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) ```npm install -g grunt-cli```
- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (for tests)

##Start the app

####First time you launch the app

```
npm install

####Start the app in Dev mode

node start.js dev

The files are generated in the folder ___dist___.

####Start the app with production files

To test the app without minification: [http://localhost:5000/index.html?beautify=true](http://localhost:5000/index.html?beautify=true)

##Unit tests

For now, real unit tests are missing, I just set up [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) with Grunt.

```
grunt test
