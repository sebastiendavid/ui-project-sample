This is a project template for front-end development.

- Served by NodeJS
- Dynamic server side Html generated by Express and Jade
- CSS generated by LESS
- Client side HTML/JavaScript powered by AngularJS
- Automated by Grunt

The goal of such project is to have a DEV MODE to facilitate the development, to generate the production files (JS & CSS minification), and to test them with the NodeJS server.  
After that, you can put your final static files where you want :)

The unit tests and integration tests are missing. Some [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) tests must be integrated with Grunt.  
Maybe some Jasmine tests for source files to test quickly the javascript, and some Karma tests for the production files...

###Requirements:

- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) ```npm install -g grunt-cli```
